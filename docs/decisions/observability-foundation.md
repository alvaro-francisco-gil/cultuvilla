# Observability foundation

## Context

The app had no client-side observability — no crash/error reporting, no product
analytics, no client logger — while Cloud Functions already had structured
Cloud Logging. We wanted a coherent, long-term foundation across all three
pillars (crash/error, analytics, health), built **web-first** but designed so the
native apps plug in unchanged when they ship. The sibling `ordago-apps` repo
provided proven patterns; we adopted its compliance posture and seam discipline
and deliberately skipped its heavier machinery.

The code is the source of truth for *what* exists (see
`packages/shared/src/services/observability/`, `apps/mobile/lib/observability/`,
`functions/src/observability/`, `functions/src/shared/observability.ts`, and the
`observability-conventions` skill). This record captures only the decisions and
why.

## Decision

- **Ports & adapters.** A platform-free *port* in
  `packages/shared/src/services/observability/observabilityService.ts` is the only
  thing screens call (`trackEvent` / `captureError` / `logger.*` /
  `setUserContext` / `setConsent` / `startOperation`). It imports no `firebase/*`
  or platform API. Concrete backends are *adapters* injected at app bootstrap
  (`configureObservability`) from `apps/mobile/lib/observability/`. This keeps the
  port unit-testable via a no-op default and makes the web→native transition a
  one-adapter change, honouring the service-layer-ownership rule.

- **Firebase Analytics for product events** (denied-by-default Consent Mode v2),
  chosen because its event API is identical on web and native — the cleanest
  transition — and BigQuery export reaches BI later for free. **No Sentry**; the
  native crash tool will be Crashlytics behind the same seam.

- **Web crash capture bridges to Cloud Logging.** Crashlytics is native-only, so
  on web a global handler + error boundary route through the `logClientError`
  callable into structured Cloud Logging → Cloud Error Reporting, *and* emit an
  `app_exception` analytics event ("both sinks"). Native later swaps
  `captureError` to Crashlytics; the analytics half is unchanged.

- **Compliance is structural, not per-call.** The server-side `log.*` chokepoint
  (`functions/src/shared/observability.ts`) auto-hashes `user.id` (HMAC-SHA256 +
  `OBSERVABILITY_USER_ID_SALT` from Secret Manager) and PII-scrubs
  `error.message`/`error.stack` via `transformAttrs`. **Never hash or scrub at the
  call site.** The raw uid never reaches a telemetry store: `logClientError`
  stamps the server-authenticated uid, and the client sets the *hashed* uid as the
  Analytics `user_id` via a `getUserIdHash` callable (cached in `AsyncStorage`).
  Right-to-erasure collapses to deleting the user doc + rotating the salt.

- **A single client-side PII allowlist.** `filterContext` (`ALLOWED_CONTEXT_KEYS`)
  drops any key outside `uid, municipalityId, villageId, role, appVersion,
  platform, route, operation_id` before a payload leaves the port.

- **Consent split.** Analytics is consent-gated (denied-by-default; a minimal
  `ConsentBar` opt-in). Error/log *diagnosis* flows regardless, on legitimate
  interest — justified because the app has guest browsing and 14+ minors.

- **Taxonomy as a review gate.** Event names live in `OBSERVABILITY_EVENTS`
  (`<domain>.<action>.<outcome>`); the `observability-conventions` skill is the
  naming/PII/debugging gate. Starter funnels: onboarding, village join, event
  sign-up, org creation.

## Consequences

- **Deliberately not built (YAGNI):** server-side OpenTelemetry, a custom
  analytics→BigQuery pipeline, dbt marts, a dashboard service, Sentry,
  distributed tracing, session replay, alerts-as-code.
- **Per-env secret required before deploy:** `OBSERVABILITY_USER_ID_SALT` must
  exist in a project before the observability functions deploy there (created on
  dev; create per-project before beta/prod promotions — see the
  `gcloud-cultuvilla` skill).
- **Alerting is manual for now:** enable Cloud Error Reporting + an email
  notification per env; alerts-as-code is deferred until real traffic.
- **Native transition** adds a Crashlytics `captureError` adapter and switches
  Analytics to the native SDK — no port or screen changes.
