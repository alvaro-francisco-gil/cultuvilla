// The strict Zod converter (makeConverter -> schema.parse) throws on read when a
// stored doc is missing a newly-required field, crashing every screen that reads
// that collection. A schema change promoted to beta/prod WITHOUT a matching
// backfill therefore ships a live crash. The reusable deploy workflow guards
// against this with a data-conformance gate that walks the target env's live
// docs through the shipped converters BEFORE any `firebase deploy`, failing the
// deploy if the data doesn't match.
//
// This invariant test fails the build if that gate is ever removed, un-guarded,
// or reordered to run after a deploy step — so the protection can't silently rot.
// Parsed as text (no YAML dep) in the same spirit as collectionGroupIndexes.test.
// See AGENTS.md "Backfill dev when a schema field is added".
